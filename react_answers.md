<!-- 

## 1. What is React?
React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It is component-based, efficient, and makes UI updates fast and predictable.

## 2. What are Components?
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based. A component is basically a function that returns JSX.

```js
function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello Tushar!</h1>
}

 -->

   <!-- // what is jsx ? -->
 <!-- JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. -->

<!-- const element = <h1>Hello</h1>; -->




   <!-- What are Props? -->
<!-- Props (short for "properties") are used to pass data from one component (usually parent) to another (child). They are read-only. -->


<!-- function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
} -->


<!-- What is useState Hook?
useState is a React Hook used to create and manage state in functional components. -->


<!-- import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
    </>
  );
} -->
