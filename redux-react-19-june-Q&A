What is React, and why is it used for building user interfaces?

React is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook. It is used for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs) where dynamic data is displayed efficiently.

Purpose of React:

Build fast, interactive, and modern UIs.

Break UI into components for better structure and reusability.

Key Benefits:

Component-Based Architecture: UI is divided into reusable components.

Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to update only the parts of the page that change, making it very fast.

Reusability: Code can be reused across different parts of the app.

Unidirectional Data Flow: Makes debugging easier.

What is a React component, and what is the difference between a functional component and a class component?

A React component is a JavaScript function or class that returns JSX to display UI. Components can be reused and nested inside other components.

Functional Component:
function Hello() {
return <h1>Hello!</h1>;
}

Class Component:
class Hello extends React.Component {
render() {
return <h1>Hello!</h1>;
}
}

Comparison:

Syntax:
Functional: Uses a simple function.
Class: Uses ES6 class.

State Management:
Functional: Uses Hooks like useState.
Class: Uses this.state.

Lifecycle:
Functional: Uses useEffect and other hooks.
Class: Uses lifecycle methods like componentDidMount.

Modern Usage:
Functional components are now preferred with hooks.
